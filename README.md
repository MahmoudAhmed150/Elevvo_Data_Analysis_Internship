## Task 1 – Titanic Survival Prediction

### 📌 Project Overview
Analyzed the Titanic dataset to explore the key factors influencing passenger survival. The goal was to perform data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract meaningful insights.

### 🔍 Key Insights
- **Gender Impact:** Females had significantly higher survival rates than males  
- **Passenger Class:** First-class passengers survived more often  
- **Age Factor:** Children had better survival chances  
- **Ticket Fare:** Higher fares correlated with higher survival  
- **Family Size:** Small families survived more than alone or very large groups  

### 📈 Visualizations
- Survival distribution, Survival by Gender/Class, Age distribution, Fare vs Survival, Family size impact, Correlation heatmap

### 🛠 Tools Used
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, Jupyter Notebook

### 📊 Dataset
Available on Kaggle: [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

## Task 2 – Online Retail RFM Analysis

### 📌 Project Overview
Analyzed an online retail dataset to calculate RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) metrics and segment customers for actionable marketing insights.

### 🔍 Key Insights
- **Customer Segmentation:** Champions, Loyal, Potential, At Risk, Lost  
- Top customers generate most revenue; product popularity varies across segments  

### 📈 Visualizations
- Bar charts for customer segments, Heatmaps of RFM scores, Scatterplots of Frequency vs Monetary

### 🛠 Tools Used
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### 📊 Dataset
Available on Kaggle: [Online Retail Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)

## Task 3 – Kaggle Data Science Survey Analysis (2017–2022)

### 📌 Project Overview
Analyzed Kaggle Data Science Survey dataset (6M+ responses) to explore trends in the global data science community, including programming languages, education levels, and tool adoption.

### 🔍 Key Insights
- Python is the dominant programming language, with steady growth  
- ML & cloud tool adoption increased after 2020  
- Most respondents hold Bachelor’s or Master’s degrees  
- Technical questions took longer to answer than demographic questions  

### 📈 Visualizations
- Trend lines, bar charts, heatmaps, categorical analysis plots

### 🛠 Tools Used
Python, Pandas, Seaborn

### 📊 Dataset
Available on Kaggle: [Kaggle Data Science Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2017)

## Task 4 – Walmart Retail Sales Analysis

### 📌 Project Overview
Analyzed Walmart retail sales data to uncover revenue trends, seasonal patterns, and impacts of promotions and economic factors. Included time-series analysis and short-term forecasting.

### 🔍 Key Insights
- **Seasonality:** Strong Q4 peaks and holiday spikes  
- **Store Type:** Type A stores generate highest revenue  
- **Department Contribution:** Small number of departments contribute most revenue (Pareto effect)  
- **Promotions & Holidays:** MarkDowns and holiday weeks increase sales  
- **Economic Factors:** Limited but observable impact on sales  

### 📈 Visualizations
- Monthly sales trend, rolling averages, exponential smoothing forecast, heatmaps, department revenue, holiday vs non-holiday sales, correlation heatmaps

### 🛠 Tools Used
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels

### 📊 Dataset
Available on Kaggle: [Walmart Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tsarina/walmart-sales-data)
